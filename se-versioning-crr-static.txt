SECTION 1: S3 Versioning
-------------------------
Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your S3 bucket.

Steps:
1. **Create a new bucket** with a globally unique name.
2. **Go to the Properties tab** of the bucket → Enable **Versioning**.
3. **Upload multiple objects** or the same object multiple times.
4. **Delete any object**:
   - A delete marker is created instead of removing the object.
5. **Enable 'Show Versions'** in the bucket to see all versions.
6. **Restore an object**:
   - Delete the delete marker version.
7. **Re-upload the same object**:
   - New versions with unique timestamps are created.

Benefits:
- Prevents accidental deletes.
- Supports rollback and auditing.

SECTION 2: Static Website Hosting
----------------------------------
Amazon S3 allows you to host static HTML/CSS/JS websites without a backend server.

Steps:
1. **Create a new S3 bucket** (must be globally unique).
2. **Upload website files**: e.g., `index.html`, `error.html`.
3. **Enable static website hosting**:
   - Go to Properties → Static Website Hosting → Enable.
   - Specify the `index.html` and `error.html` files.
4. **Fix permissions**:
   - Enable ACLs (Access Control Lists).
   - Set objects to public.
   - Optionally add a bucket policy for public read access.
5. **Access the site** using the provided static web hosting endpoint.
6. **Test error fallback**:
   - Delete or rename `index.html` to see `error.html` in action.

Use Case:
- Perfect for hosting portfolios, landing pages, or documentation.

SECTION 3: Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
-----------------------------------------
CRR automatically replicates S3 objects from one bucket in one region to another bucket in a different region.

Steps:
1. **Create the source bucket** in one region (e.g., `ap-south-1`).
   - Enable **Versioning** (mandatory).
2. **Create the destination bucket** in a different region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
   - Also enable **Versioning**.
3. **Create a Replication Rule** in the source bucket:
   - Go to Management tab → Replication Rules → Add rule.
   - Choose the destination bucket.
   - Choose or create an IAM role for replication.
4. **Create a Batch Operation Job** (optional):
   - Useful to replicate existing objects.
   - Define IAM role, manifest, and destination settings.
5. **Test replication**:
   - Upload an object to the source bucket.
   - Wait and verify it's replicated in the destination bucket.

Bidirectional Replication (Optional):
1. **Create a rule in the destination bucket** to replicate back to source.
2. **Repeat the steps**: set destination, IAM role, and create a batch job.
3. **Upload a file** in the destination bucket to see it appear in the source bucket.

---

Final Notes:
- Ensure both buckets have versioning enabled.
- IAM roles used in CRR must have S3 replication permissions.
- Use batch jobs for large-scale replication.
- S3 provides detailed logging and metrics in CloudWatch for monitoring replication.
