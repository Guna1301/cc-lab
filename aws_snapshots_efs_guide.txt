===================================

SECTION 1: EBS Snapshots
------------------------
Purpose: Back up an EBS volume and restore or copy it across regions.

1. Launch a new EC2 instance and attach an extra 20 GB EBS volume.
2. SSH into the instance and list block devices:
     lsblk
3. Partition, format, and mount the extra volume:
     sudo -i
     lsblk -l
     fdisk /dev/xvdf
       n  → new
       p  → primary
       ENTER (accept defaults)
       w  → write
     partprobe
     mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1
     mkdir /mnt/data
     mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/data
4. Make the mount persistent:
     vi /etc/fstab
     /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/data xfs defaults 0 0
     mount -a
5. Create a snapshot:
     • EC2 Console → Volumes → select volume → Actions → Create Snapshot.
6. Create a new volume from the snapshot:
     • EC2 Console → Snapshots → select snapshot → Actions → Create Volume.
7. Launch a new instance in the same AZ and attach the volume created from the snapshot.
8. SSH into the new instance:
     lsblk
     mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/data   # if needed
     ls /mnt/data                 # verify data (e.g., Maven_se folder).

SECTION 2: AWS EFS
------------------
Purpose: Provide shared file storage that multiple EC2 instances can access simultaneously.

1. Launch Instance‑1 in subnet / AZ “east‑a”.
   • Create/choose a security group allowing inbound NFS (TCP 2049).
2. Launch Instance‑2 in AZ “east‑c” using the *same* NFS security group.
3. In AWS Console → EFS → Create File System.
   • Ensure mount targets are created in both “east‑a” and “east‑c”.
   • Modify each mount target’s security group to the NFS group.
4. Retrieve the mount helper command:
   • EFS Console → File System → Attach → Copy the command that starts with
     sudo mount -t efs …
5. From each instance:
     sudo -i
     mkdir /mnt/efs
     yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
     mount -t efs fs-XXXXXXXX:/ /mnt/efs
     cd /mnt/efs
     vi f1    # create a test file
6. Verify that the test file appears on both instances.

Clean‑Up Tips
-------------
• Unmount and detach volumes when finished to avoid charges.
• Delete snapshots or EFS file system if no longer needed.
