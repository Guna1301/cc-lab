Attaching and Detaching Volumes with in same region of EC2

Step 1. Launching an Instance with Additional Volumes:
- Start by launching an instance from the EC2 dashboard. Choose your desired AMI (Amazon Machine Image), instance type, and other configurations.

- In the "Add Storage" step, you can add additional volumes. Specify the size and other attributes for these volumes.

Step 2. Detaching a Volume from an Instance:
  	 - Navigate to the EC2  and select "Volumes" under EBS section from the left-hand menu.
  	 - Locate the volume you want to detach from the instance.
 	 - Select the volume, then choose "Actions" -> "Detach Volume".
    	 - Confirm the detachment by clicking "Yes, Detach".

Step 3. Attaching a Volume to Another Instance:
  	 - After detaching the volume, it will become available. 
 - Select the detached volume from the Volumes list.
   	- Choose "Actions" -> "Attach Volume".
   	- Select the instance you want to attach the volume to
- specify the device name (e.g., /dev/sdf), and then click "Attach".
   	- Once attached, the volume will appear as an additional disk on the chosen instance.
Step 4: Attach and Mount EBS Volume to Linux EC2
Attach the volume via AWS Console.
•	Connect to EC2 via SSH.
•	Check available disks (lsblk).
Here you see root volume and attached (eg:-xvdf)

lsblk -fs    # Check filesystem type
Create a partition using fdisk:
fdisk /dev/xvdf
o	Press m → Show help menu
o	Press n → Create a new partition
o	Press p → Create a primary partition
o	Press Enter twice → Use default partition size
o	Press w → Write changes and exit
Partprobe   # Inform the kernel about partition changes
Verify the new partition:
Lsblk  -fs
Format the Disk Partition
mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1   # For XFS
Verify the filesystem:
lsblk -fs
Mount the Partition
Steps:
Create a directory for mounting: 
1.	mkdir /mnt/archana
Mount the partition: 
2.	mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/archana
Verify the mount: 
3.	df -h
Make the Mount Persistent
Steps:
Edit    /etc/fstab to add the following line: 
nano /etc/fstab
Add this line at the end: 
<device>  <mount_point>  <filesystem_type>  defaults 0 0
Now you see your volume is persistent
